# Projects:

This repository contains the projects I worked on in the past years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PYTHON

1) Color and Pixel Manipulation:

This program contains functions that rotate images as well as invert their colour and adjust their brightness levels. This is done through treating the images as arrays that contain pixel information and manipulating their RGB properties.

2) Machine Learning AI for Story Generation:

This program reads a given text file, and learns the grammar and sentence syntax in that file. It then attempts to generate a story based on a token (initial word) and a seed (order information). The results vary depending on the length of the initial file to be read and the seed generated. The current code is built based on the story "Three Men in a Boat" by Jerome K. Jerome.

# MATLAB

1) Euler Approximations and Curve Fittings:

As a part of my Linear Algebra course (ESC103), I learned how to code a script that approximates the integral of a function based on different euler approximations. Furthermore, I also programmed a script to fit a curve based on a set of points using the least-squares methods.

# AUTOCAD

1) Automoblox Prototype:

This was a project I made in grade 9. It involved prototyping an Automoblox car, which required extensive use of Autodesk Inventor. In the end, we were also required to simulate the physics of the car parts to model a real life car.

2) Civil Engineering Design

As a part of a civil engineering course I took in grade 10, I was required to design a Shed using Autodesk Revit. Furthermore, I was also required to render the shed at different stages of the project.
